/// The FFI Interface for initialization of Viam's Orientation Vector format.
/// Like an axis angle, the format involves a vector axis and a rotation
/// theta (in radians). However, unlike an axis-angle, an orientation vector alters
/// the axes of the given frame of reference by rotating the z-axis to the
/// vector axis provided. The new x-axis is the vector that is both orthogonal to
/// the vector axis provided and co-planar with both the old
/// z-axis and the vector axis (this leaves two choices for the y-axis,
/// but the canonical "right-hand rule" is used to select one consistently). Then,
/// a clockwise-rotation of theta is applied about the new-z axis
///
/// It is highly recommended not to attempt any mathematics with the orientation
/// vector directly and to convert to quaternions via the FFI interface instead
